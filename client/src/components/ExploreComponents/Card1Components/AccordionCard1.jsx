              construction of dark matter spacecrafts, plotting course for Lanai II, a moon orbitting Kepler 22b, a close cousin of the Earth.

              With this technology, humanity could look forward to comfortably preparing the next generation of humans on Lanai.

              <strong>As the clich√© goes, "With great power, comes great responsibility".</strong> MAT Corp. created the Solar Domes to provide sustenance and
              shelter the last of humanity. As such, they held a massive amount of leverage over the rest of the population. As the years passed by and comfort set in,
              corruption began to take hold. 
            <p class="text-white text-base mt-4">
              High-ranking MAT Corp. executives were found stealing food, drink, medicine, and other supplies. Rationing was nowhere to be seen
              and nepotism was rampant. Accusers, usually poor, low-ranking citizens working the farms, were punished through violence or most often, starvation, ridding them
              of the exact thing that they provide back to the community.
