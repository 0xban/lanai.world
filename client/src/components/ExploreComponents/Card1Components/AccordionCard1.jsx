              <strong>As the clich√© goes, "With great power, comes great responsibility".</strong> MAT created the Solar Domes to provide sustenance and
              shelter the last of humanity. As such, they held a massive amount of leverage over the rest of the population. As years passed by and comfort set in,
              corruption began to take hold.

            <p className="text-white text-base">
              High-ranking MAT executives were found stealing food, drink, medicine, and other supplies. Rationing was nowhere to be seen
              and nepotism was rampant. Accusers, usually poor, low-ranking citizens working the farms, were punished through violence or most often, starvation, ridding them
              of the exact thing that they provide back to the community.

              With more and more of the lower-class citizens rebelling against MAT for its poor management of planetary resources, chaos was underway. In order to avoid this,
              MAT created <strong>The Ring</strong>, a method of solving disputes among citizens. In lieu of a traditional judicial system, MAT employed the use of an arena
              to solve problems, justifying its use by asserting its "simplicity," allowing executives to focus on providing Lanai with the resources to grow. With the upper-class 
              citizens and executives not willing to fight for their own skin, the lower-class citizens stepped up to battle in their place, in exchange for a more comfortable life.
